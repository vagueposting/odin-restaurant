# Odin Restaurant

**Languages used:** JavaScript, CSS, JSON

A website built entirely with JavaScript. The objective was to create a restaurant SPA, and I feel like I succeeded.

I really like sticky sidebars. I think that says a lot about my age. :)

## Reflection
### Overall Thoughts
If there's one thing this project told me is that I will enjoy working with React much.

Even if I'm not in the React module yet, I found that a lot of declarative patterns in that framework are similar to this pure-vanilla solution.

### New things learned
- Dynamically inserting content using JSON and loops (I think I'm too early for this but that's okay.)
- Using maps and first-class citizen functions to construct DOM elements.

### What could be improved
- More images.
- More standardized styling for menu pages.
- Increased interactivity.
